# Map Reduce c

In today's world, due to the spread of the Internet and smart devices, a large amount of data is generated daily. In the past, generated data could be stored and run on a hardware device, but today this is impossible for many. Reduce-Map is a programming framework and model for processing large amounts of data, and many of its concepts are derived from function-oriented languages such as Lisp.

In this project, you will implement the word counter using the procedure. Note that you will be given a folder called testcases that contains a number of csv files. The file names are csv.num. Each of these files contains a number of words separated by. For example, files can look like this:
- 1.csv

there, is, an, old, time, toast, which, is, golden, for, its, beauty
- 2.csv

Hi, there, is, a, golden, goal, which, can, eat, toast

For this system, three types of processes with the names of main process, mapping process and reduction process are considered.

### The program must be run using the makefile and the g++ compiler
